SORT
=====

wait wait wait.. so hear me out. sort is awesome. but we need classid and some other stuff. so i give you class id and some other stuff. BUT! when ran it needs some ... other stuff. so im definitely gonna do an example and all that. 


i couldnt. that rum was way too good. 
all creds goes to the man himself: abewley. or woman. or it. i dunno in 2021. https://github.com/abewley/sort
